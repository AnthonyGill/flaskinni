# Flaskinni
### [Documentation](https://gilmour.gitbook.io/compsci/web-development)
This is meant to be an open-source template for Flask applications. Flask is an amazing framework because it 's so simple and minimal. It's a great way learn web development as you have to build all the scaffolding that Rails and other frameworks build for you. However, assembling the many helpful Flask modules can be a real chore. Flaskinni helps by bundling many of these resources. It's intended to serve as a starting point for students who have been studying Flask and are now ready to start a larger project.

### Install
1. Create a virtual environment and once activated, `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Install postgresql on your machine, create a database (you can name it whatever you'd like but you'll need to enter the name into your `private.py` file). Note your admin account's username and password
3. Create a `private.py` file as well as a `.env` file based off the examples in the [documentation](https://gilmour.online/compsci/web-development/3-flaskinni#your-machine)
4. `flask run`
