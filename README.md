# Flaskinni
### [Documentation](https://gilmour.gitbook.io/compsci/web-development)
This is meant to be an open-source template for Flask applications. Flask is an amazing framework because it 's so simple and minimal. It's a great way learn web development as you have to build all the scaffolding that Rails and other frameworks build for you. However, assembling the many helpful Flask modules can be a real chore. Flaskinni helps by bundling many of these resources. It's intended to serve as a starting point for students who have been studying Flask and are now ready to start a larger project.
